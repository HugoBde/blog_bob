# BLOG_BOB

## What is blog_bob
`blob_bob` is a microservice I developed to support my continuously deployed blog. It monitors a folder for new or updated markdown files, and converts them to HTML blog articles in sub millisecond time (that's not actually true yet). It also updates a supporting PostgreSQL database which catalogues all the articles and helps the main backend server render the blog homepage.

## Why the name "blog_bob"?
I am a huge fan of Bob the Builder, and attribute my "can-do" attitude and love for tinkering and building things to him. Since `blog_bob` helps me **build** my blog, I wanted to dedicate this project to Bob the Builder as a thank you for the positive impact he has had on my life.
